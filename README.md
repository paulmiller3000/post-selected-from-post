# Post Selected from Post
This was a real-world problem I had to solve. Users would enter a date range and return a series of records from the database to a PHP page. 

The use case was to then select one record and post it to another PHP page.

This is a work in progress. As of 7/15/18, it works. I need to refactor the section that gets tableBody, as it's fragile... it'll break if the page layout changes.

Updates to follow.
