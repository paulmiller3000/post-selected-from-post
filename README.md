This was a real-world problem I recently had to solve. 

Use case: Users would enter a date range and return a series of records from the database to a PHP page. Then, they needed to select one record and post it to an existing PHP page.

Working demo at https://postfrompost.paulmiller3000.com.

## Getting Started
Create a new database and user. Be sure to grant your user SELECT and EXECUTE privileges on your database.

Use database-load-sample.sql to load records. 

Execute devCharacters.sql to create the stored procedure.
